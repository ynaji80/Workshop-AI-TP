The Revolution culminated in the rise of the radical Jacobin government, led by Maximilien Robespierre, which instituted a Reign of Terror. This period saw the beheading of the French monarch, King Louis XVI, and the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte after the French Republican Army defeated the armies of Europe. \\n\\nThe Napoleonic Era (1799-1815): After assuming power, Napoleon established the French Consulate (with himself as leader) and enacted a series of legal and social reforms that continued the ideals of the French Revolution and solidified his rule. He crowned himself Emperor in 1804 and expanded the French Empire, leading an unsuccessful invasion of Britain and the Continental Coalition that culminated at the bloody Battle of Waterloo. \\n\\nThe Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune (1870-1871): This war, fought between France and Prussia (later Germany), ended in a decisive Prussian victory and the capture of Paris.
